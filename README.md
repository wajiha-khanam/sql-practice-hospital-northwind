# SQLPractice.com – Querying Through Hospital & Northwind Datasets

Welcome to my curated repository of SQL solutions based on challenges from [SQLPractice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com). This project showcases my structured problem-solving approach using two well-known practice datasets: `hospital.db` and `northwind.db`.

## ✅ Dataset Completion Status

| Dataset        | Progress       | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 🏥 hospital.db  | ✅ Completed    | Queries on patients, admissions, and doctors |
| 🌍 northwind.db | ⏳ In Progress | Classic business use-case — coming soon!     |

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Joins and relational data handling  
- Aggregation and grouping functions  
- Filtering, sorting, and conditional logic  
- Subqueries and window functions  
- Real-world insights drawn from healthcare and commerce datasets
